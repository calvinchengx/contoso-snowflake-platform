"""Pull Contoso Reference over HTTP and land it in the internal stage.

THE FOURTH VENDOR, and the first that is not an operational system. POS, Web and
ERP each record things that happened; this one publishes the definitions they
are all reported against. It is a vendor rather than a table maintained inside
the platform because that is what it is in the business: the group data office
owns it, issues a credential for it, and changes it on its own schedule.

WHY THIS STEP VERIFIES A CHECKSUM WHEN NO OTHER INGEST DOES. Every other feed is
text, so damage in transit announces itself. Parquet does not: it keeps its
`PAR1` magic and footer through byte-level corruption, so a ruined file passes
every cheap check and fails much later inside a reader, naming neither the
transport nor the cause. The vendor publishes the digest of what it sent, and
this compares it before anything else happens.

REWRITTEN AS CSV, and this is the one honest compromise in the ingest path.
`COPY INTO` accepts TYPE = PARQUET, reports `ok` and loads nothing
(snowflake-emulator#20). Both of this vendor's exports are FLAT tables -- a
product rollup and a daily FX table -- so CSV carries every column and every
value without loss. The checksum is still verified against the bytes that
ARRIVED, before the rewrite, so the guard protects the transport it was written
for. The day that copy path works, this step lands the Parquet untouched.
