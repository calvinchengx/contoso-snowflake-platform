"""Pull Contoso Web over HTTP and land it in the internal stage.

THE SECOND VENDOR, and the reason there is one. Two vendors is where the work
starts: two credentials that rotate separately, two formats that agree about
nothing, and two customer lists describing overlapping people without either
system knowing the other exists.

WHAT THIS VENDOR SENDS: JSON arrays, and orders arrive NESTED -- one order
carries its own `lines`, because the storefront thinks in baskets. Accounts are
keyed on email, not an id, which is what makes joining this to POS a resolution
problem rather than a join.

LANDED AS JSON TEXT, ONE DOCUMENT PER ROW. This engine's `COPY INTO` accepts
TYPE = JSON, reports `ok` and loads nothing (snowflake-emulator#20), so the
documents ride in as a single CSV column and silver parses them. That is not a
workaround dressed up: loading JSON into one column and parsing it downstream is
the ordinary Snowflake pattern -- it is what VARIANT is for.

WHAT IS NOT DONE HERE IS THE FLATTENING. The page array is a transport
container, so one row per element is the same bronze the other cells hold. The
`lines` array inside each order is DATA, and it stays nested exactly as it
arrived -- exploding it here would move a transform out of silver, where it is
visible and tested, into ingest, where it is neither.
