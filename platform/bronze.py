"""Landing to bronze, by COPY INTO from the internal stage.

BRONZE IS SQL HERE, not Spark. That is the whole point of this cell: the other
runtimes hand their bronze to an engine that speaks DataFrames, and Snowflake
does not have one — it has a warehouse and a stage. `COPY INTO` reading a prefix
of staged parts is what a Snowflake team writes, and it is a different shape of
the same step rather than a port of somebody else's.

THE COLUMNS ARE THE VENDOR'S, in the order the vendor serves them. A CSV copy is
positional, so a column list that drifts from the export does not fail — it
loads the right bytes into the wrong columns, which is worse. The header row the
vendor sends is the authority, and `_assert_header` checks it before any copy.
