"""Pull Contoso POS over HTTP and land it in the internal stage.

THIS CELL HAD NO SOURCE SYSTEMS AT ALL. It seeded empty silver tables and built
gold over them, so it could report shapes but never evidence -- the family's
numbers are comparable only because every cell pulls the same bytes from the
same pinned simulator.

CUSTOMERS ARE LANDED VERBATIM. The vendor serves delimited text and the stage
takes delimited text, so the bytes that arrive are the bytes `COPY INTO` reads.
The other three vendors are not so lucky: `COPY INTO` accepts TYPE = JSON and
TYPE = PARQUET, reports `ok`, and loads nothing
(snowflake-emulator#20), so they need a landing shape this engine can actually
read. That is a compromise; this one is not, which is why it is first.

PAGED, and the pages are landed as separate parts rather than stitched back
into one file. Reassembling here would put the whole export in this process's
memory -- the exact thing paging removes -- and a directory of parts is what
`COPY INTO` wants anyway: it reads a prefix.
