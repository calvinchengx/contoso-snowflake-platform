"""Consume the ERP change stream and land it in the internal stage.

This is the boundary. Everything upstream -- Postgres, Debezium, Redpanda -- is
the world outside the warehouse; everything downstream is inside it. The
consumer is the only thing that touches both, which is exactly where a real
ingestion job sits.

WHY A STREAM AND NOT A TABLE READ. The ERP is the one vendor whose value is its
history. Reading `erp.customer` directly would produce rows -- possibly even a
plausible count -- while testing something else entirely: a snapshot cannot say
that a customer was in Germany before they were in France, and SCD2 over a
snapshot is SCD1 wearing a longer name.

WHAT IS PRESERVED AND WHAT IS NOT. Counts survive real CDC: the same DML
produces the same events. LSNs, commit timestamps and Kafka offsets do not --
they differ every run, and nothing here asserts on them. `effective_date`
travels as DATA, which keeps the fixture's deliberate disagreement between
capture order and business order intact.

LANDED AS CSV, for the reason ingest_reference gives: TYPE = PARQUET copies
report `ok` and load nothing here (snowflake-emulator#20). The change log is a
flat table of scalars, so CSV loses nothing.
